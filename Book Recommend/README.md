# Project Overview

This project looks to do some Exploratory data analysis on the data from the book archives recorded over some period 

My codes are written in Jupyter notebook usin python. And the Aim of this project is to build a recommender system to recommend books for user to read. This would be treated later but for now the focus is on the Cleaning, Wrangling and Analysis of the datasets.

**Project Steps**

* Create functions to which looks into a dictionary then loads the data into the dataframe if the user input is a member of the dictionary given
* Create functions that checks thorugh the columns of the loaded data table to determine if there is any null value or misrepresentation of data
* Create functions that cleans the data, remove all null values and unwanted rows and columns in the data tables
* Create functions that loads present charts for better understanding of data.

## Code 

You can find the code to this project [here](https://github.com/PhagoroyeBabs/) `N.B` This is just a part of the project and i am still working on the rest.

# Data Used 

The data used in this project is gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset). However i have created a folder of the dataset in my [github repository](https://github.com/PhagoroyeBabs/All-About-Data-Analysis/tree/master/Book%20Recommend)

> # Code Editor
> You can use any editor of your choice but i prefer using VScode.
